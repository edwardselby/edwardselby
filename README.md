# Edward Selby

Principal Developer & Technical Lead at OneTwenty Group.

Most of my work lives in private repositories — I maintain a microservices platform spanning 60-80 repos: real-time sports data feeds, odds processing, event-driven architectures, and B2B integrations at scale. What you see here are side projects and experiments.

## What I work with

**Day job:** Python, PHP/Symfony, RabbitMQ, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, AWS, Docker  
**Currently exploring:** AI-assisted development workflows, LLM-driven TDD pipelines

## Background

Self-taught developer with 10+ years in distributed systems. I like ownership-heavy roles where I can drive architecture decisions end-to-end. Previously co-founded a business at 21 where I taught myself to code while running telecommunications contracts across the UK.
